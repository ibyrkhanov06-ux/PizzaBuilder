This project demonstrates the **Builder Design Pattern** in Java while following the principles of **Clean Code**.  
It provides a flexible way to create `Pizza` objects with different ingredients, showing how the Builder pattern improves readability and maintainability.

## 📖 Features
- Build a pizza step by step using a fluent API.
- Add or skip ingredients (cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, etc.).
- Check if a specific ingredient exists in the pizza.
- Example of applying **Clean Code principles** to a common design pattern.

## 🧾 Clean Code Principles Applied
- **Meaningful names** (clear class and method names).  
- **Small functions** (each method does one thing).  
- **Readable structure** (fluent Builder for better readability).  
- **Avoid duplication** (common logic encapsulated in one place).
